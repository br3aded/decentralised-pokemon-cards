# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

make sure node.js is installed
ensure hardhat is installed locally in the project directory with `npm install --save-dev hardhat`

To run project
`npx hardhat node`
`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
`npm run dev`
